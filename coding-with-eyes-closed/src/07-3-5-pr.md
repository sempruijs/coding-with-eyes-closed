# Make a pull request

Goal: Get familiar with reading code from someone else.

## Intro

I really like open source software because I can make it accessible myself. 
If an button is labelled bad for instance, I can change the label so that it has a better description.

Reading someone elses code can be a challenge. Especially if that person is a bad coder. 
Opening a pull request is an good way to train with reading code that you did not write.

Feel free to open a pull request for this book if you find a spell mistake for instance.
