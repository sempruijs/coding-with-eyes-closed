# Where to start?

That you're reading this book is probably because of a accident or a disease. 
I am sorry for you.
Everything is going to be just fine. 
There is a lot possible and there are a lot of accessible tools. 
I will talk briefly about operating systems, screen readers and braille. 
Ready? Lets go!
