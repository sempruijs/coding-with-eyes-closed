# Screen readers

Feel free to skip parts if you already use a screen reader.

## What's a screen reader?

According to the definition of [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader):

_"A screen reader is a form of assistive technology that renders text and image content as speech or braille output."_

If you don't like the voices of a screen reader, you still need one because it is also used for braille.

Here are some sources if you want to learn more about screen readers:

### I don't need a screen reader

Screen readers are extremely useful. Even if you have enough sight to read large text.  It is useful. Here is why. 
Visually impaired users do not only have an problem with their eyes, they have a problem with energie through out the day. 
You need twice as much energie to perform a task then visual people. If you want to be productive, you need to optimize as much as possible not only to be faster, but to save energie so you can invest it in the right type of activity.
When I am coding, I need my energie for coming up with a good, elegant and scalable solution.
That energie should not go in reading text on your screen. 

Now that I have more sight, I use large text in my editor, but I still read documentation with a screen reader because it costs less energie.

If you are visually impaired, learn how to use a screen reader. It is a bit of a investment, but you earn it back with having more energie for solving problems.


## Give me a screen reader!

First learn a screen reader on a smartphone. Why? 
Smartphones have simple user-interfaces. 
Navigating apps on a smartphone is relatively easy.
This way, you can get used to the idea of navigating based on sounds instead of light.

If you learned how to use your smartphone without sight, learn a screen reader for the desktop. 
Desktop screen readers are more complex, but once you learned a mobile screen reader, you can make the switch!

## What desktop screen reader?

Feel free to experiment, you'll have to figure out what works for you. Here are my quick recommendations. 

#### Windows

If you are on windows, use [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/). It is fast, open source and free.
You have other options, but they are slow and too complex and crash allot. NVDA is not only free, it is better then the payed options.

#### Mac

I like VoiceOver the most. Navigating is fast, you do not have to install anything and grouping elements makes finding the right button very easy.

If you want to learn VoiceOver for mac, press ```CMD F5```, follow the build-in tutorial and read the [VoiceOver user guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac)

#### Linux

On linux, you have [orca](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/introduction.html.en) that you have to use with GNOME.
I do not recommend this. If you have to use linux, SSH into a virtual machine and use the MacOS or windows screen reader.
