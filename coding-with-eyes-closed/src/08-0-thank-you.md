# Thank you!

Amazing that you've read the book. I really hope that I helped you in the right direction.

I want to thank people who helped me on this journey. 
Coding with eyes closed was a relatively long journey for me.

I want to thank God.
It was such a hard time when I was diagnosed and he gave me everything I needed and more.

My eye disease brought me to Jesus who gave me strength to write this book and many other projects.

God gave me through his love so much. Such as:

- [bartimeus](https://bartimeus.nl) who learned me tips and tricks about screen readers, mobility and emotional support.
- [mike](https://retro-kingdom.nl/over-ons) who gave me very helpful tips for coding with eyes closed. I do not know where I would've been without his tips, especially his braille advice.
- [eric](https://github.com/edequartel) who learned me braille with his amazing [braille pi](https://github.com/edequartel/BraillePiServer).
- [jurriaan](https://github.com/qlp) for emotional and financial support and managing my cables when I could not see them :)
- [cor](https://github.com/cor) who motivated me and supported me on my nixos and rust journey.
- My family for emotional support and motivation.

And he gave amazing contributors:

- [AntObr](https://github.com/AntObr)
- [btotr](https://github.com/btotr)

God bless all these people who helped me so much üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüë®‚Äçü¶Ø
